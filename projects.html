    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <p>
        This is a summary of open-source projects I've been involved with. For closed-source projects, you might find
        some stories in my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> or summaries on my <a href="/about.html">about page</a>.
    </p>



    <h2>Professional</h2>
    
    <p>
        Some projects from my jobs are open source. They might be business-specific, but they still are a great
        example of how myself and the team were solving business problems&hellip;

    <h2>Personal</h2>

    <p>
        I also like tinkering with ideas and seeing where they end up. Some of my work ends up on

    <h2>Contributions</h2>

    <p>
        I would not and could not be the developer I am without the time others have invested in publishing open source
        software. For my modest part, I've been able to contribute back to&hellip;
