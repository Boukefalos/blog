    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>
        I like tinkering with ideas and seeing where they end up. Some of my work ends up on
        <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but here are some of my noteworthy projects&hellip;
    </p>

    <h3>Personal</h3>

    <p>
        A few personal projects I've invested in&hellip;

    <h4>CLI for OpenGrok</h4>
        
    <p>
        Command line interface for getting results from an OpenGrok server.

    <h3>Contributions</h3>

    <p>
        I would not and could not be the developer I am today without the time others have invested in producing
        quality, open source software. For my modest part, I've been able to contribute to the following:

        <li><a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits?author=dpb587">symfony/symfony</a> &ndash; small enhancements and bug fixes</li>
