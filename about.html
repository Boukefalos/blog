    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        I am a <em>software engineer</em> who enjoys pushing the limits of <em>web technology</em> and applying them to <em>business processes</em>.
        Ideally, my job provides me with technical challenges that require <em>practical solutions</em>. I have a
        solid understanding about industry best practices, but I am more interested in <em>continuously learning</em> about how and
        why those practices can be <em>challenged and improved</em>.
